## Changelog

- **1.4.1** - 2020-11-30
  - updated OpenTK via NuGet, version 3.1 now

- **1.4** - 2016-06-05
  - renamed nodes.xml to functions.xml (format extended), contains defines, helpers and all code nodes
  - nodes can have a 'comment' attribute now which is displayed in the properties panel when the node is selected
  - function tags can have a 'requires' attribute now (name of other node or helper) to maintain code dependencies
  - Zwerg writes only required functions to the shader now (preparation for minify features)
  - renamed raymarcher.fs to shader.fs, moved optional code to functions.xml
  - integrated most operators of the [Mercury SDF Library](http://mercury.sexy/hg_sdf/)
  - **PLEASE NOTE: Scene files created with earlier versions won't load because SDF function definitions have changed! The scene file format itself has not changed.**
  
- **1.3** - 2014-06-15: external nodes.xml (contains all available nodes from scene view context menu), simplified internal tree structure and code cleanup, fixed: node order
